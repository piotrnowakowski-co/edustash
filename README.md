# Snax 🍿

A personal workspace and collection of quick, reusable code "snax" – small, tasty bites of code that I grab for everyday development and learning.

## About

**snax** is my digital snack drawer: a mix of experimental code for learning and handy utilities/snippets I may at some point use in real projects.

This repo serves two main purposes:

- **Educational playground** 🤔: Experiments, tutorials, proof-of-concepts, and messy trial-and-error code while exploring new languages, frameworks, tools, or concepts. It's a safe sandbox where perfection isn't required.
- **Handy code bits for daily work** 🛠️: Reusable snippets, one-liners, helper functions, scripts, config templates, debugging tricks, and language-specific idioms that solve recurring problems across projects.

Think of it as a curated (but ever-growing) collection of bite-sized tools and ideas – quick to copy, satisfying to use, and always evolving.

Feel free to browse, fork, or borrow anything useful. Contributions of new tasty snax are welcome! 🚀
